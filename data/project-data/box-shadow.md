### Why?

I've made the box shadow generator because I found myself looking way too often for a proper
tool to generate beautiful CSS box shadow. All the tools that I could find, however, only allowed 
one box shadow, even though the CSS specification allows for an element to have multiple shadows. 

I then decided to make my own box shadow generator, with support for layered shadows. This 
project has come very useful to myself already, and I am sure it could be of great use 
for other web developers. 

### How?

Box Shadow Generator is built using React.js. This allows it to be fast and make all necessary 
calculations in real time. When a new shadow is added or edited, the generated CSS is also 
instantly updated. 
For the page design, I haven't used any CSS frameworks. It was designed using pure CSS.
